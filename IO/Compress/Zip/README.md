The primary purpose of this module is to provide streaming write access to zip
files and buffers. It is not a general-purpose file archiver. If that is what
you want, check out [Archive::Zip](https://github.com/ReneNyffenegger/PerlModules/tree/master/Archive/Zip).

See also `IO::Compress::Gzip` and
[IO::Uncompress::Gunzip](https://github.com/ReneNyffenegger/PerlModules/tree/master/IO/Uncompress/Gunzip).
