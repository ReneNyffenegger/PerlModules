# Perl Modules

(Very) simple scripts for some Perl modules, intended as copy paste templates.

For each module in this repository there is (or should be) at least a `script.pl`
to demonstrate a small but working example of the module.

Everyone is invited to participate and add his/her `script.pl`, too.

The scripts are mirrored on my (http://renenyffenegger.ch/notes/development/languages/Perl/modules/index)[website].

## Misc

Find the location of an installed package with `perldoc -l Package::Name`.
